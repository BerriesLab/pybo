## List of symbols and definitions

+ EDM: Electric Discharge Machining
+ DS-EDM: Die-Sinking Electric Discharge Machining
+ W-EDM: Wire Electric Discharge Machining
+ MRR: Material Removing Rate ($\sim 100 \,\mathrm{mm^3/min}$ or $10^{-6}-{10^{-4}} \,\mathrm{mm^3/spark}$)
+ ML: Machine Learning
+ AI: Artificial Intelligence
+ FPGA: Field Programmable Gate Array
+ IDT: Ignition Delay Time, or Breakdown Time Lag (BTL), is the time between the application of the voltage and the
  dielectric breakdown.
+ V: voltage delivered by the generator. Note that the generator cannot control this voltage during the electrical
  discharge, but only during the pre-breakdown phase.
+ I: electrical discharge current.
+ on-time: duration of the electrical discharge.
+ Gap: distance between the electrode and the workpiece during a discharge ($\sim 10-100\,\mathrm{\mu m}$)
+ Crater: the crater left on the workpiece at the end of the discharge ($\sim 1-500\,\mathrm{\mu m}$)
+ Polarity: the polarity of the electrode with respect to the workpiece. A positive (negative) polarity means that the
  electrode voltage is higher (lower) than the workpiece voltage.
